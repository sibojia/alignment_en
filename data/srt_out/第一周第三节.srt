1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:14,68
Let's take a look at this painting by Van Gogh.

2
00:00:15,47 --> 00:00:17,25
We can see some roses in it.

3
00:00:20,19 --> 00:00:23,95
However, after an X-ray scan, we have discovered 

4
00:00:23,95 --> 00:00:26,36
that behind this colourful painting,

5
00:00:27,01 --> 00:00:29,72
there in fact is a portrait of a wrestler.

6
00:00:31,82 --> 00:00:34,08
Such paintings-within-paintings

7
00:00:34,63 --> 00:00:37,01
are not limited to the field of art.

8
00:00:38,1 --> 00:00:41,19
Similar examples are to be found in mathematics.

9
00:00:42,0 --> 00:00:43,77
We all know Archimedes, right?

10
00:00:44,35 --> 00:00:47,97
He has made significant contributions to 

11
00:00:47,97 --> 00:00:52,86
various branches of mathematics, physics and engineering, etc.

12
00:00:53,41 --> 00:00:56,01
So what contributions has he to combinatorics?

13
00:00:56,67 --> 00:01:00,19
Today, let's take a look at a photo of Archimedes' manuscript.

14
00:01:05,78 --> 00:01:07,87
Here is a photo of an ancient text.

15
00:01:09,14 --> 00:01:11,06
A glance does not seem reveal

16
00:01:11,06 --> 00:01:12,71
any links with mathematics - 

17
00:01:13,65 --> 00:01:14,99
there are no symbols,

18
00:01:15,58 --> 00:01:16,31
no graphs...

19
00:01:17,74 --> 00:01:21,89
This is in fact a religious text.

20
00:01:21,89 --> 00:01:23,28
The history of it goes like this:

21
00:01:24,55 --> 00:01:26,28
Around the 10th century A.D.

22
00:01:27,09 --> 00:01:29,36
Some scribes copied Archimedes' work,

23
00:01:29,91 --> 00:01:31,99
word for word, onto parchment.

24
00:01:33,11 --> 00:01:35,11
Over the course of history,

25
00:01:35,11 --> 00:01:36,49
and the passing of time

26
00:01:37,14 --> 00:01:39,57
these parchment scrolls were lost

27
00:01:40,31 --> 00:01:43,34
and found there way into various monasteries,

28
00:01:44,25 --> 00:01:47,65
where the monks, upon receipt of the scrolls,

29
00:01:47,65 --> 00:01:49,25
simply rinsed them all.

30
00:01:50,69 --> 00:01:53,82
After the original text had been washed away,

31
00:01:53,82 --> 00:01:56,65
they reused the parchment to copy the Scriptures.

32
00:01:57,48 --> 00:01:59,92
After the passing of 1000 years,

33
00:01:59,92 --> 00:02:01,86
through times of war and peace,

34
00:02:02,5 --> 00:02:05,2
only fragments of these scrolls survive today.

35
00:02:05,98 --> 00:02:07,33
It was only recently

36
00:02:07,33 --> 00:02:09,09
that people began to suspect

37
00:02:09,09 --> 00:02:11,46
that there may be more to be discovered.

38
00:02:12,26 --> 00:02:14,84
Sure enough, after an X-ray,

39
00:02:14,84 --> 00:02:17,16
these shapes began to appear.

40
00:02:17,16 --> 00:02:21,57
It would seem that underneath these scriptures there are complex drawings

41
00:02:22,56 --> 00:02:27,96
Now we also note that this ancient Greek is written horizontally.

42
00:02:29,36 --> 00:02:31,54
People gradually realised that

43
00:02:31,54 --> 00:02:35,08
this mathematical work seems to be by Archimedes' hand.

44
00:02:38,53 --> 00:02:41,39
So it's time we examine the details more closely.

45
00:02:41,39 --> 00:02:42,85
After X-ray (and some other) scans,

46
00:02:42,85 --> 00:02:45,34
we can see that under these scriptures,

47
00:02:45,34 --> 00:02:47,77
there is a mathematical paper in Ancient Greek.

48
00:02:48,61 --> 00:02:50,79
So what, exactly, does this paper deal with?

49
00:02:51,44 --> 00:02:55,33
The answer is in fact Archimedes' Stomachion(14-piece dissection puzzle).

50
00:02:55,33 --> 00:02:56,77
When stomachion puzzles are mentioned,

51
00:02:57,4 --> 00:03:01,02
Chinese students amongst us may automatically think of tangrams.

52
00:03:01,64 --> 00:03:06,6
Yes, there is a degree of similarity between the stomachion and tangrams,

53
00:03:06,6 --> 00:03:08,32
But Archimedes didn't study

54
00:03:08,32 --> 00:03:11,41
how many elephant shapes you can make from a stomachion,

55
00:03:11,41 --> 00:03:13,41
or even how many soldier shapes!

56
00:03:14,09 --> 00:03:18,23
Instead, he investigated the very interesting problem of:

57
00:03:18,23 --> 00:03:22,4
if this stomachion can be pieced together to create a square,

58
00:03:22,4 --> 00:03:24,6
how many ways, precisely,

59
00:03:24,6 --> 00:03:25,92
do we have of

60
00:03:25,92 --> 00:03:29,78
reassembling it and putting it back in this square box?

61
00:03:30,32 --> 00:03:35,29
After mathematicians learned of the problem from the manuscript in 2003,

62
00:03:35,87 --> 00:03:39,47
it garnered significant attention from the community.

63
00:03:42,06 --> 00:03:46,89
Of course, many mathematicians felt that this problem was very complex,

64
00:03:46,89 --> 00:03:49,17
and almost impossible to solve.

65
00:03:49,17 --> 00:03:51,11
So a mathematician had the idea 

66
00:03:51,11 --> 00:03:53,77
to offer a prize for its solution.

67
00:03:53,77 --> 00:03:55,08
He took a sum of money,

68
00:03:55,64 --> 00:03:57,29
not too much of course,

69
00:03:57,29 --> 00:03:59,09
only 100 dollars or so£¬

70
00:03:59,95 --> 00:04:02,48
and created a 100-dollar prize fund,

71
00:04:02,48 --> 00:04:04,32
for the first person to come up with 

72
00:04:04,32 --> 00:04:06,27
an exact solution.

73
00:04:06,27 --> 00:04:10,7
Naturally many people all over the world began investigating this problem,

74
00:04:10,7 --> 00:04:12,48
including mathematicians

75
00:04:12,48 --> 00:04:13,67
and computer scientists.

76
00:04:14,36 --> 00:04:16,62
Let's all guess whether it was

77
00:04:16,62 --> 00:04:17,85
the computer scientists

78
00:04:17,85 --> 00:04:20,12
or the mathematicians who won this prize?

79
00:04:21,56 --> 00:04:24,39
I think most us will guess correctly -

80
00:04:25,07 --> 00:04:28,19
indeed it was the computer scientists who

81
00:04:28,19 --> 00:04:30,36
devised an algorithm.

82
00:04:30,36 --> 00:04:32,69
An enumerative method was used

83
00:04:32,69 --> 00:04:36,77
to ultimately generate the correct answer. So for the stomachion,

84
00:04:36,77 --> 00:04:39,14
how many distinct combinations are possible?

85
00:04:40,02 --> 00:04:42,33
17152

86
00:04:42,99 --> 00:04:47,44
Of course, mathematicians were not far behind either.

87
00:04:47,44 --> 00:04:49,05
They didn't use computers;

88
00:04:49,05 --> 00:04:51,95
Instead, they used exclusively combinatorics

89
00:04:51,95 --> 00:04:53,73
to arrive at the same solution.

90
00:04:54,51 --> 00:04:56,83
The playful Archimedes began the 

91
00:04:56,83 --> 00:04:58,43
chapter on Western combinatorics.

92
00:04:59,3 --> 00:05:01,2
As for the word "combinatorics",

93
00:05:01,81 --> 00:05:03,28
what are its origins?

94
00:05:04,09 --> 00:05:09,74
It can actually be attributed to Leibniz in 1666.

95
00:05:10,36 --> 00:05:12,43
When studying probability,

96
00:05:12,43 --> 00:05:13,79
He coined the term

97
00:05:13,79 --> 00:05:14,21
combinatorics.

98
00:05:15,24 --> 00:05:16,33
In terms of English,

99
00:05:16,33 --> 00:05:17,16
created the name for

100
00:05:17,16 --> 00:05:22,94
Combinatorics. He stated that all deductions and discoveries, 

101
00:05:22,94 --> 00:05:26,46
regardless of whether they are described in human language,

102
00:05:27,05 --> 00:05:32,89
can all be categorised into some ordered combination 

103
00:05:32,89 --> 00:05:36,75
of the elements of numbers, words, sounds and colours,

104
00:05:37,26 --> 00:05:40,62
The study of calculating this ordered set

105
00:05:40,62 --> 00:05:41,53
is combinatorics.

106
00:05:42,29 --> 00:05:45,09
After we have reviewed the history of combinatorics,

107
00:05:45,09 --> 00:05:48,42
both its development in the West and its origins in the East.

108
00:05:48,42 --> 00:05:49,81
We must be curious:

109
00:05:49,81 --> 00:05:52,18
what applications has combinatorics in real life?

110
00:05:52,87 --> 00:05:56,89
Next lesson, we shall analyse this more deeply for everyone.
