1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,02
I think we've all thought about it long and hard.

2
00:00:04,53 --> 00:00:05,96
How did you arrive at your answer?

3
00:00:07,98 --> 00:00:11,54
Suppose we want to have all the nations of the world

4
00:00:11,54 --> 00:00:14,49
participating in the World Cup elimination stage.

5
00:00:14,49 --> 00:00:20,6
So if there are 224 teams proceeding to the elimination stage,

6
00:00:21,15 --> 00:00:22,97
how many matches will be played?

7
00:00:22,97 --> 00:00:24,12
So how did everyone

8
00:00:24,12 --> 00:00:25,26
solve the quiz problem?

9
00:00:26,24 --> 00:00:30,38
Perhaps you drew a very complicated decision tree,

10
00:00:30,38 --> 00:00:33,81
and counted up all the nodes to find out the solution.

11
00:00:33,81 --> 00:00:37,7
If there are now 224 nations in the knockout matches,

12
00:00:39,25 --> 00:00:40,51
will you still count like this?

13
00:00:41,15 --> 00:00:43,35
How large must your decision tree be?

14
00:00:44,6 --> 00:00:46,46
Is there a better way?

15
00:00:46,46 --> 00:00:48,5
Let's try to get to the solution quickly.

16
00:00:48,5 --> 00:00:50,0
If we reconsider the problem,

17
00:00:51,26 --> 00:00:54,53
it's actually saying that in every match,

18
00:00:54,53 --> 00:00:57,01
there has to be a winner and a loser,

19
00:00:59,02 --> 00:01:04,22
with the loser being eliminated. How many ultimately remain?

20
00:01:05,67 --> 00:01:07,63
Only the champion is left standing.

21
00:01:08,61 --> 00:01:12,74
Every match corresponds to an eliminated team.

22
00:01:12,74 --> 00:01:16,18
So the number of teams eliminated

23
00:01:16,18 --> 00:01:18,14
is equal to the number of matches!

24
00:01:18,98 --> 00:01:23,41
If out of 16 teams, we have to eliminate 15,

25
00:01:23,41 --> 00:01:26,76
then there has to be 15 matches.

26
00:01:26,76 --> 00:01:30,65
Now with 224 nations participating,

27
00:01:30,65 --> 00:01:34,52
we need to eliminate 223 teams in total.

28
00:01:34,52 --> 00:01:38,54
Then naturally 223 matches have to be played.

29
00:01:38,54 --> 00:01:41,03
This problem no longer requires us to 

30
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,48
draw up such a complicated decision tree.

31
00:01:44,03 --> 00:01:46,36
We use a one-to-one correspondence

32
00:01:46,36 --> 00:01:50,16
to show that if there are n teams participating

33
00:01:50,16 --> 00:01:53,96
then we need exactly n-1 elimination matches.

34
00:01:53,96 --> 00:01:56,76
This one-to-one correspondence (injectivity)

35
00:01:56,76 --> 00:02:01,18
demonstrates that brute-force enumeration is not always necessary.

36
00:02:01,18 --> 00:02:03,44
We can use a degree of abstraction

37
00:02:03,44 --> 00:02:05,95
to generate an ingenious idea,

38
00:02:05,95 --> 00:02:09,01
which might make the problem wonderfully simple.
