1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,83
Next we'll introduce to everyone

2
00:00:02,83 --> 00:00:06,94
a famous problem known as the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg.

3
00:00:08,85 --> 00:00:13,97
Konigsberg is a city in Prussia with breathtaking scenery.

4
00:00:14,7 --> 00:00:16,63
This city is very charming.

5
00:00:17,16 --> 00:00:20,85
If we look into its colourful history, we shall find

6
00:00:20,85 --> 00:00:26,23
that it was the birthplace of many great mathematicians and philosophers.

7
00:00:27,16 --> 00:00:33,53
The philosopher Kant and mathematician Goldbach 

8
00:00:34,56 --> 00:00:35,7
were both born here.

9
00:00:36,88 --> 00:00:41,57
Apart from the great thinkers it has produced, of especial note is the

10
00:00:41,57 --> 00:00:43,33
river passing through Konigsberg.

11
00:00:44,15 --> 00:00:47,96
The river branches into two in the city,

12
00:00:47,96 --> 00:00:50,04
splitting the city into four pieces.

13
00:00:50,99 --> 00:00:54,99
To connect together the islands and other parts of the city,

14
00:00:54,99 --> 00:00:57,43
seven bridges were built over the river.

15
00:00:59,12 --> 00:01:03,25
Yet the distribution of the seven bridges is very interesting.

16
00:01:03,87 --> 00:01:06,23
So in Konigsberg,

17
00:01:07,66 --> 00:01:10,06
the locals enjoy an interesting game:

18
00:01:10,67 --> 00:01:12,96
When they are strolling on the seven bridges -

19
00:01:14,12 --> 00:01:16,49
which seem to connect everything together -

20
00:01:18,8 --> 00:01:22,9
they would try to cross over all the bridges exactly once.

21
00:01:23,77 --> 00:01:26,01
This problem of traversing all seven bridges

22
00:01:26,01 --> 00:01:30,6
is the notable "Seven Bridges of Konigsberg".

23
00:01:31,24 --> 00:01:32,83
We might think here,

24
00:01:32,83 --> 00:01:35,57
so what? It's only crossing all the bridges,

25
00:01:36,19 --> 00:01:39,75
so let's just enumerate all the permutations by brute force.

26
00:01:40,42 --> 00:01:42,55
Since no repetitions are allowed,

27
00:01:42,55 --> 00:01:48,05
so we are simply limited to permutations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, right?

28
00:01:48,76 --> 00:01:51,8
How many permutations of 7 numbers are there?

29
00:01:51,8 --> 00:01:54,61
7!=5040 different solutions.

30
00:01:55,44 --> 00:01:59,21
But there are many false solutions contained there.

31
00:01:59,74 --> 00:02:04,24
For example, it might be impossible to go directly from one bridge to another.

32
00:02:04,88 --> 00:02:08,16
A permutation like this would not be a valid solution.

33
00:02:09,0 --> 00:02:13,47
Say you physically attempt all 5040 possible solutions.

34
00:02:13,98 --> 00:02:17,73
If you actually try and walk out one possible solution a day,

35
00:02:17,73 --> 00:02:19,97
You'll need 13 years to try them all.

36
00:02:20,55 --> 00:02:24,68
This problem became a very popular topic, which Konigsbergers loved to

37
00:02:24,68 --> 00:02:26,19
analyse in their free time.

38
00:02:26,97 --> 00:02:31,73
At that time, several undergraduates found it a very interesting problem,

39
00:02:31,73 --> 00:02:33,49
Yet, try as they might,

40
00:02:34,17 --> 00:02:35,89
they couldn't find a valid solution.

41
00:02:36,93 --> 00:02:43,75
So they emulated Goldbach and penned a letter to Euler.

42
00:02:43,75 --> 00:02:49,44
Euler is certainly a master of his craft. He discovered after several trials

43
00:02:49,44 --> 00:02:52,68
that there doesn't seem to be any valid solutions.

44
00:02:52,68 --> 00:02:54,07
So he changed tack

45
00:02:54,07 --> 00:02:57,24
and considered the possibility that it was impossible

46
00:02:57,24 --> 00:03:01,82
to traverse all seven bridges exactly once.

47
00:03:01,82 --> 00:03:05,69
Euler only needed several days to solve this difficult problem.

48
00:03:06,74 --> 00:03:07,85
His answer? O solutions.

49
00:03:09,89 --> 00:03:11,37
How did he accomplish this?

50
00:03:12,84 --> 00:03:15,73
He certainly didn't use complete enumeration.

51
00:03:16,46 --> 00:03:20,16
He didn't even label all the bridges 1, 2, 3, ... 7.

52
00:03:20,16 --> 00:03:24,67
Instead he conducted a magnificent method.

53
00:03:24,67 --> 00:03:27,15
He converted the seven bridges to a graph,

54
00:03:28,84 --> 00:03:30,9
with the landmasses as nodes

55
00:03:32,51 --> 00:03:35,55
and the bridges as the edges between the nodes.

56
00:03:37,19 --> 00:03:39,59
This graph, with the seven edges,

57
00:03:39,59 --> 00:03:42,82
exactly corresponds with the seven bridges of Konigsberg.

58
00:03:43,62 --> 00:03:46,9
Wishing to traverse all seven bridges exactly once

59
00:03:46,9 --> 00:03:51,69
is equivalent to asking if it's possible, on this graph,

60
00:03:51,69 --> 00:03:54,45
to draw out all the edges in a single stroke.

61
00:03:56,13 --> 00:03:59,76
This abstraction by Euler is very neat.

62
00:04:00,56 --> 00:04:03,95
He abstracted the original problem into a graph,

63
00:04:04,59 --> 00:04:07,74
which he then transformed into a one-stroke problem.

64
00:04:07,74 --> 00:04:12,51
Euler eventually wrote a very well known paper,

65
00:04:12,51 --> 00:04:15,71
which is often regarded as the beginning of topology.

66
00:04:17,16 --> 00:04:22,73
In 1736 he published the first paper in the world

67
00:04:22,73 --> 00:04:24,09
about graph theory,

68
00:04:24,09 --> 00:04:27,4
which discussed the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg.

69
00:04:27,4 --> 00:04:29,81
He not only employed abstraction,

70
00:04:29,81 --> 00:04:33,18
but simultaneously proved the necessary and sufficient condition

71
00:04:33,18 --> 00:04:34,58
for drawing out the graph

72
00:04:34,58 --> 00:04:35,48
in a single stroke.

73
00:04:38,0 --> 00:04:41,12
First you need all the nodes to be connected.

74
00:04:41,73 --> 00:04:46,51
Aside from this he classified all the nodes into two types,

75
00:04:46,51 --> 00:04:51,44
according to the number of edges adjacent the node. If the number is odd,

76
00:04:51,44 --> 00:04:53,41
the node is an odd node.

77
00:04:54,04 --> 00:04:58,51
Else, if the number of adjacent edges is even, the node is even.

78
00:04:58,51 --> 00:05:01,45
So a necessary sufficient condition for a graph

79
00:05:01,45 --> 00:05:03,58
to be drawable in a single stroke:

80
00:05:03,58 --> 00:05:06,9
the number of odd nodes must either be 0 or 2.

81
00:05:08,86 --> 00:05:12,79
Let's return to the graph of Konigsberg's Seven Bridges.

82
00:05:12,79 --> 00:05:15,16
Does it satisfy the previous condition?

83
00:05:16,34 --> 00:05:18,2
This graph has four nodes,

84
00:05:20,0 --> 00:05:22,31
with every node being connected to

85
00:05:22,31 --> 00:05:24,09
3 or 5 edges.

86
00:05:25,32 --> 00:05:27,84
Therefore all 4 nodes are odd.

87
00:05:30,3 --> 00:05:33,5
The necessary and sufficient condition for being able

88
00:05:33,5 --> 00:05:36,25
to draw this graph in a single stroke states

89
00:05:36,25 --> 00:05:40,7
that the number of odd nodes must either be 0 or 2.

90
00:05:40,7 --> 00:05:44,04
Clearly the Seven Bridges do not satisfy this condition,

91
00:05:44,61 --> 00:05:49,79
So Euler didn't need 13 years to walk out all the solutions,

92
00:05:49,79 --> 00:05:52,68
but simply state there is no solution

93
00:05:52,68 --> 00:05:55,82
that traverses all seven bridges exactly once.

94
00:05:57,45 --> 00:05:59,27
With the passing of time, 

95
00:05:59,27 --> 00:06:02,32
the problem gradually faded from people's minds.

96
00:06:03,55 --> 00:06:05,13
Yet the story continues,

97
00:06:06,66 --> 00:06:10,75
Some bridges were retired from service for want of repairs.

98
00:06:11,83 --> 00:06:15,91
Now we can see that the nature of the graph has changed.

99
00:06:16,86 --> 00:06:20,23
For example, if we remove this edge at the corner,

100
00:06:21,58 --> 00:06:25,49
we find that the number of odd nodes has been reduced by 2,

101
00:06:26,41 --> 00:06:28,76
with only 2 odd nodes remaining.

102
00:06:29,79 --> 00:06:32,3
Now Euler's condition regarding the

103
00:06:32,3 --> 00:06:34,72
single-stroke problem is satisfied.

104
00:06:37,46 --> 00:06:39,56
Since there exists a solution,

105
00:06:40,17 --> 00:06:42,33
we might quite naturally ask next

106
00:06:43,16 --> 00:06:44,89
how many solutions are there to

107
00:06:44,89 --> 00:06:47,82
traverse all six bridges exactly once?

108
00:06:51,93 --> 00:06:56,61
This problem seems to be a generalisation of Euler's problem.

109
00:06:57,15 --> 00:07:00,98
In Euler's paper,he not only stated

110
00:07:00,98 --> 00:07:05,89
the necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a solution,

111
00:07:06,83 --> 00:07:10,9
but presented us with a general guiding principle.

112
00:07:10,9 --> 00:07:13,21
He stated that to solve the problem,

113
00:07:13,21 --> 00:07:17,0
then one possibility is that there are 0 odd nodes.

114
00:07:17,0 --> 00:07:19,32
This means that all the nodes are even.

115
00:07:19,91 --> 00:07:21,21
When this occurs,

116
00:07:21,21 --> 00:07:23,94
and you want to complete a graph in one stroke,

117
00:07:23,94 --> 00:07:26,43
you can start from any even node,

118
00:07:26,43 --> 00:07:28,58
and at the end return to it.

119
00:07:29,94 --> 00:07:32,84
Should you have 2 odd nodes however,

120
00:07:32,84 --> 00:07:35,44
you must begin from one odd node,

121
00:07:35,44 --> 00:07:37,05
and end up at the other.

122
00:07:38,56 --> 00:07:42,2
With these two conditions, we discover that

123
00:07:42,2 --> 00:07:47,78
to find all the solutions traversing all six bridges exactly once,

124
00:07:48,53 --> 00:07:52,93
we do not need to resort to complete enumeration.

125
00:07:52,93 --> 00:07:54,96
This is because we already know

126
00:07:54,96 --> 00:07:57,48
that if there are only two odd nodes,

127
00:07:58,07 --> 00:08:01,1
then we have to start from an odd node and

128
00:08:01,1 --> 00:08:02,68
end up at the other odd node.

129
00:08:02,68 --> 00:08:06,4
In fact, in the field of computer algorithms

130
00:08:06,4 --> 00:08:09,03
this traversal of all edges exactly once

131
00:08:09,03 --> 00:08:10,97
is a special problem of its own.

132
00:08:11,82 --> 00:08:15,33
In fact, solutions to this problem are named after Euler:

133
00:08:16,12 --> 00:08:18,03
we call them Eulerian paths.

134
00:08:18,78 --> 00:08:21,33
So how many Eulerian paths are there in total?

135
00:08:22,19 --> 00:08:23,13
If we code up

136
00:08:23,13 --> 00:08:25,25
a fast and efficient algorithm,

137
00:08:27,23 --> 00:08:28,64
then we shall discover

138
00:08:28,64 --> 00:08:32,08
that we are basically still using enumeration.

139
00:08:33,04 --> 00:08:36,68
However, it doesn't seem to be quite so brute-force.

140
00:08:36,68 --> 00:08:41,76
In the traditional sense of brute-force enumeration,

141
00:08:41,76 --> 00:08:44,29
we mean that all possible solutions are listed.

142
00:08:44,89 --> 00:08:47,13
But here, due to Euler's work,

143
00:08:47,13 --> 00:08:50,15
we can use his theorem to deduce the solutions.

144
00:08:50,15 --> 00:08:53,95
We discover that the process becomes simpler and much more natural.

145
00:08:55,45 --> 00:09:00,14
Therefore, even though enumeration is a basic principle in counting,

146
00:09:00,99 --> 00:09:04,16
abstraction makes it really powerful.

147
00:09:04,16 --> 00:09:07,95
Under many circumstances, without a computer,

148
00:09:07,95 --> 00:09:11,57
a human's capacity for enumeration is very limited.

149
00:09:12,86 --> 00:09:15,84
Combinatorics uses this mode of thought

150
00:09:15,84 --> 00:09:19,42
to instruct computers to use abstract methods,

151
00:09:19,42 --> 00:09:24,15
to make the enumerative process that much more elegant and concise.

152
00:09:24,81 --> 00:09:28,24
This is the magic behind combinatorics.
