1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,3
After this period of study,

2
00:00:03,3 --> 00:00:06,76
we now understand that much of combinatorics is counting.

3
00:00:07,83 --> 00:00:08,7
its goals are

4
00:00:08,7 --> 00:00:09,21
twofold.

5
00:00:09,83 --> 00:00:12,66
Nothing should be repeated or missed.

6
00:00:14,31 --> 00:00:18,91
In fact counting is not as simple as we'd all like to think,

7
00:00:18,91 --> 00:00:22,58
because of the sheer size of the dataset we're facing.

8
00:00:22,58 --> 00:00:26,47
Moreover, the elements of the dataset have complex relations.

9
00:00:26,47 --> 00:00:29,57
So to count well, to study combinatorics well,

10
00:00:29,57 --> 00:00:31,94
we require some skill with abstraction.

11
00:00:32,71 --> 00:00:36,44
Some of the methods used in combinatorics are not all that deep,

12
00:00:37,08 --> 00:00:42,46
but some brilliant ideas involved allow us to logically partition cases. 

13
00:00:43,44 --> 00:00:46,69
We need to grasp how to change our perspective.

14
00:00:46,69 --> 00:00:50,14
So combinatorics is indeed a very attractive field.
