00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,984
Welcome everyone, I am Prof. Yuchun Ma from the Department of Computing Science at Tsinghua University.

2
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:20,428
I am very glad to see everyone here£¬

3
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:24,721
so let's enjoy the beauty of combinatorics together.

4
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:27,579
Here at the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University,

5
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,478
Combinatorics is a fundamental course set at the graduate level.

6
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,069
But then we might ask,

7
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,783
since we have taken so many maths courses throughout our education,

8
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:38,904
why do we have yet another maths course at the graduate level?

9
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:44,940
We might not have heard of combinatorics before,

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,678
so if we want to find out what it is£¬

11
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,960
let's go online to have a look.

12
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,876
We can find the entry for combinatorics on Wikipedia.

13
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:09,580
The definition on Wikipedia is as follows:

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,302
"Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics..."

15
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:16,484
Right, so it's a branch of maths that deals with 

16
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:20,320
problems of ordering and combining in discrete maths,

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,409
in particular methods of counting.

18
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:27,341
In fact the main application of combinatorics is for counting.

19
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,371
So what will we study?

20
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:32,372
Ordering(permutations) and combining (combination) problems from discrete maths.

21
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,892
So we might then wonder

22
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,514
if we've already studied undergraduate discrete maths,

23
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:41,055
would we have already covered everything to do with combinatorics£¿

24
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:44,297
We can have a look at a popular textbook.

25
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:49,547
Take this popular textbook on discrete maths.

26
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:50,695
Let's take a look

27
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:52,658
at what it contains.

28
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,110
We flip over to the contents page,

29
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,744
and discover that there are ten whole chapters.

30
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:00,665
Only in chapter 8

31
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:05,321
do we find some basics of combinatorial analysis,

32
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:08,062
in which there are a few simple counting algorithms,

33
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:11,593
and introductory concepts regarding permutations and combinations.

34
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:13,628
So we see that in discrete maths,

35
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:18,518
We only come across some very rudimentary combinatorics.

36
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,038
In this class however,

37
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:24,998
We shall really delve into combinatorics and related fields£¬

38
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:28,836
not least familiar concepts such as permutations and combinations.

39
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:31,599
We shall pay particular attention to a recursive counting algorithm

40
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,928
with wide-ranging applications in computing.

41
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:39,927
We'll also cover the inclusion-exclusion and the pigeonhole principles.

42
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,690
Finally, we shall investigate the very interesting topic of

43
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,100
counting the colourings of polygons,

44
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,413
using Burnside's lemma and the Polya enumeration theorem.

45
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,385
We can therefore see that combinatorics will involve

46
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,994
in-depth study of counting algorithms of discrete objects.

47
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:57,796
Next,

48
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:02,032
we shall take a brief overview of the history of mathematics.

49
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:03,878
Let us start from this graph:

50
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:05,025
what does the first illustration depict?

51
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:07,132
This is in fact

52
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:11,493
a calculating tool used by the people of the ancient Incan Empire.

53
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:15,843
We can say that mathematics has its roots in counting.

54
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,768
Then, after grasping the fundamental concept of counting, 

55
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:21,088
we began to develop arithmetic,

56
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,601
elementary algebra, geometry, etc.,

57
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:26,432
until the appearance of variables in the 17th century.

58
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:29,171
From then on, mathematics moved into virgin territory,

59
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,560
and thus began the research of more advanced mathematical topics,

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
for example linear algebra, probability, etc.

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,258
The collective term given to these topics is mathematical analysis,

62
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:36,754
whose fertile grounds has produced

63
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:40,262
such mathematical greats as Leibniz, Euler, Gauss, etc.

64
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:44,969
Later, we discovered that mathematical analysis alone is insufficient.

65
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:46,908
So upon the foundations of mathematical analysis,

66
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:50,841
we developed topology, abstract algebra, group theory,

67
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,641
set theory, number theory etc.

68
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:55,285
These form the basis of modern mathematics.

69
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,970
With the development of computers,

70
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,436
people gradually found that combinatorics has become

71
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:03,335
a very important branch of modern mathematics,

72
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:08,600
for it directly impacts upon the theoretic development of informatics.

73
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,019
From our review of the development of mathematics,

74
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,852
We discover that the general development of mathematics

75
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,080
mirrors our own mathematical education.

76
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,901
There are many parallels to our personal experiences with mathematics.

77
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:22,187
When we are very young,

78
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:24,947
we begin counting from 1, 2, 3...

79
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,258
During our secondary education,

80
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:29,882
We'd already learned arithmetic and begin studying algebra and geometry.

81
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,140
Upon entering university,

82
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,293
we first encounter formal mathematical analysis:

83
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,331
we study advanced mathematics,

84
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:37,014
investigate linear algebra, etc.

85
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,297
But for modern mathematics,

86
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:42,799
we require more specialised tool and techniques.

87
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,854
For example we learn about graph theory and topology.

88
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:48,289
Combinatorics is specially relevant for computing

89
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,567
and forms part of the theoretical backbone for computer science.

90
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:55,238
Only after detailed study (perhaps at the graduate level),

91
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:58,222
can we hope to gain a more thorough understanding of algorithms.

92
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:01,744
To paraphrase the celebrated combinatorist Brualdi,

93
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:04,351
what is combinatorics really concerned with?

94
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,239
It investigates things that obey, to some degree, a rule or pattern.

95
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,611
Then we ask ourselves,

96
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,775
under such a rule,

97
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,832
do they exist,

98
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:14,616
how many distinct forms can they take,

99
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,966
can the algorithm be ¡®improved¡¯ in some way?

100
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:21,227
In combinatorics, then, we aim to answer three major questions.

101
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:22,984
First, the question of existence.

102
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,638
Second, the question of counting.

103
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,870
Third, the question of optimisation.

104
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,579
Since we now understand exactly what combinatorics is,

105
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,971
we shall, in the next lesson, explore in depth

106
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:36,487
the origins of combinatorics.
