1
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:15,542
Let's take a look at this painting by Van Gogh.

2
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:20,033
We can see some roses in it.

3
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:24,221
However, after an X-ray scan, we have discovered 

4
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,056
that behind this colourful painting,


5
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:31,532
there in fact is a portrait of a wrestler.

6
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,228
Such paintings-within-paintings

7
00:00:34,348 --> 00:00:36,709
are not limited to the field of art.

8
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,071
Similar examples are to be found in mathematics.

9
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:44,765
We all know Archimedes, right?

10
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:48,580
He has made significant contributions to 

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,247
various branches of mathematics, physics and engineering, etc.

12
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:56,137
So what contributions has he to combinatorics?

13
00:00:56,257 --> 00:01:00,165
Today, let's take a look at a photo of Archimedes' manuscript.

14
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:09,203
Here is a photo of an ancient text.

15
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:12,481
A glance does not seem reveal

16
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,592
any links with mathematics - 

17
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:15,905
there are no symbols,

18
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,059
no graphs...

19
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:21,836
This is in fact a religious text.

20
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,139
The history of it goes like this:

21
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,365
Around the 10th century A.D.

22
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,547
Some scribes copied Archimedes' work,

23
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:34,113
word for word, onto parchment.

24
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,547
Over the course of history,

25
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,536
and the passing of time

26
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:41,200
these parchment scrolls were lost

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,705
and found there way into various monasteries,

28
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:47,566
where the monks, upon receipt of the scrolls,

29
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:50,818
simply rinsed them all.

30
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:53,144
After the original text had been washed away,

31
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:56,178
they reused the parchment to copy the Scriptures.

32
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,978
After the passing of 1000 years,

33
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:01,652
through times of war and peace,

34
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:03,969
only fragments of these scrolls survive today.

35
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:05,957
It was only recently

36
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:07,201
that people began to suspect

37
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:12,697
that there may be more to be discovered.

38
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,598
Sure enough, after an X-ray,

39
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,783
these shapes began to appear.

40
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:23,813
It would seem that underneath these scriptures there are complex drawings

41
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:28,983
Now we also note that this ancient Greek is written horizontally.

42
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:31,183
People gradually realised that

43
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:36,545
this mathematical work seems to be by Archimedes' hand.


44
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:41,285
So it's time we examine the details more closely.

45
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:43,438
After X-ray (and some other) scans,

46
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:46,469
we can see that under these scriptures,

47
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:49,978
there is a mathematical paper in Ancient Greek.

48
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:51,548
So what, exactly, does this paper deal with?

49
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:57,071
The answer is in fact Archimedes' Stomachion(14-piece dissection puzzle).

50
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,685
When stomachion puzzles are mentioned,

51
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,984
Chinese students amongst us may automatically think of tangrams.

52
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:05,822
Yes, there is a degree of similarity between the stomachion and tangrams,

53
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:09,496
But Archimedes didn't study

54
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:13,356
how many elephant shapes you can make from a stomachion,

55
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,275
or even how many soldier shapes!

56
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,389
Instead, he investigated the very interesting problem of:

57
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,859
if this stomachion can be pieced together to create a square,

58
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,869
how many ways, precisely,

59
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,157
do we have of

60
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:30,158
reassembling it and putting it back in this square box?

61
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:36,148
After mathematicians learned of the problem from the manuscript in 2003,

62
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:41,459
it garnered significant attention from the community.




63
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,398
Of course, many mathematicians felt that this problem was very complex,

64
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:48,537
and almost impossible to solve.

65
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:50,150
So a mathematician had the idea 

66
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,629
to offer a prize for its solution.

67
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,123
He took a sum of money,

68
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,130
not too much of course,

69
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,814
only 100 dollars or so£¬

70
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,388
and created a 100-dollar prize fund,

71
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:04,112
for the first person to come up with 

72
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,332
an exact solution.

73
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:09,846
Naturally many people all over the world began investigating this problem,

74
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,213
including mathematicians

75
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,959
and computer scientists.

76
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,581
Let's all guess whether it was

77
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,296
the computer scientists

78
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,500
or the mathematicians who won this prize?

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,513
I think most us will guess correctly -

80
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:30,195
indeed it was the computer scientists who

81
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,621
devised an algorithm.

82
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:33,119
An enumerative method was used

83
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:37,063
to ultimately generate the correct answer. So for the stomachion,
84
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,400
how many distinct combinations are possible?

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,315
17152

86
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,984
Of course, mathematicians were not far behind either.

87
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,041
They didn't use computers;

88
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,685
Instead, they used exclusively combinatorics

89
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,752
to arrive at the same solution.

90
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:57,361
The playful Archimedes began the 

91
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:01,223
chapter on Western combinatorics.

92
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,006
As for the word "combinatorics",

93
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:05,503
what are its origins?

94
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:08,945
It can actually be attributed to Leibniz in 1666.

95
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,910
When studying probability,

96
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,684
He coined the term

97
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:15,023
combinatorics.

98
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:16,170
In terms of English,

99
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,388
created the name for

100
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:22,062
Combinatorics. He stated that all deductions and discoveries, 


00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:27,306
regardless of whether they are described in human language,

102
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:30,887
can all be categorised into some ordered combination 

103
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,445
of the elements of numbers, words, sounds and colours,

104
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,486
The study of calculating this ordered set

105
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:41,743
is combinatorics.

106
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,106
After we have reviewed the history of combinatorics,

107
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:47,313
both its development in the West and its origins in the East.

108
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,908
We must be curious:

109
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:53,655
what applications has combinatorics in real life?

110
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:56,731
Next lesson, we shall analyse this more deeply for everyone.
