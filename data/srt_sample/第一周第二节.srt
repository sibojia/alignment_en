1
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,124
So, can we tell what this is?

2
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:27,036
This is one of the earliest examples of combinatorics - magic squares.

3
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:30,037
Combinatorics is an ancient field.

4
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,503
Its history may be traced back over 4000 years

5
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:34,469
to the age of the Great Yu.

6
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:38,991
According to Chinese myth, the Great Yu tamed the Yellow River.

7
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:40,436
There is a legend that says:

8
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:41,935
while working to tame the river,
9
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,946
The Great Yu was very worried.

10
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,799
One day, he was strolling by the riverbank,

11
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:49,739
when a giant tortoise rose from the Yellow River.

12
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,742
This tortoise was not only huge, 

13
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:53,094
but even more amazingly,

14
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:56,519
there were mysterious patterns on its back.

15
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,406
If we study the patterns carefully,

16
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,238
we discover that its back is divided up into nine squares.

17
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:04,048
Each square contains a number of dots.

18
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:07,608
If we add up the dots of each row,

19
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,776
or of all columns,

20
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:12,723
or even of each diagonal,

21
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:15,250
all add up to 15.

22
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,838
Fifteen is quite a special number in the Chinese lunar calendar,

23
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:23,892
since solar terms last fifteen days each.

24
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:26,995
So the Great Yu was inspired by this mysterious pattern,

25
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:31,534
and divided the work accordingly into fifteen days periods.

26
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:35,300
Magic squares appear not only in ancient literature,

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,599
but even in well-known works in film and television,

28
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,967
they appear frequently.

29
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:43,568
Next, we'll watch a short clip from "The Legend of the Condor Heroes"

30
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:53,338
Ying-gu, who lives in the cabin by the black swamp,

31
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,867
was studying how to form a 3x3 magic square.

32
00:01:56,987 --> 00:01:58,929
Yet over a decade passed,

33
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,637
and she still could not reach a perfect solution.

34
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:05,312
Until Rong Huang came to the cabin, that was...

35
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,792
Your arithmetic obviously bests me,

36
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:09,058
but let me ask you.

37
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,933
Separate the numbers one to nine into three columns,

38
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:13,550
so that for every row, column and diagonal,

39
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,985
The sum of the three numbers is fifteen.

40
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,441
How to order the numbers?

41
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:19,959
Magic square of nine, use the method of the tortoise:

42
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,948
Two and four the shoulders, six and eight the feet.


43
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:24,058
three left, seven right, nine top and one bottom.

44
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,611
Five in the middle.

45
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:31,941
I thought I created this magic formula,

46
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,427
but little did I suspect that it is laid down in verse!

47
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:38,220
Then how do you transform each square into eight-diagrams?

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,036
Eight times nine is seventy-two.

49
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:41,961
For the numbers from one to seventy-two,

50
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:45,023
Encircle the nine squares with eight numbers each time,

51
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,939
with four circles at the intersections.

52
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,579
Altogether there are thirteen circles.

53
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:51,167
The sum of the numbers in each circle comes to 292.

54
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,145
This is the magic of the graph from the Book of Luo.

55
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:57,976
You won't understand anyway.

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,536
So is it really as commonplace as Rong Huang says?

57
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:07,859
In fact the first person to investigate magic squares

58
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,236
should be the mathematician Hui Yang from the Southern Song dynasty.

59
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:14,942
In China, Pascal's Triangle is actually named Hui Yang's Triangle.

60
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:16,611
Aside from this,

61
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:21,619
He authored the very interesting mathematical treatise "Classic Algorithms".

62
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:28,155
Within, he detailed 3 by 3, 4 by 4, 5 by 5

63
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,448
and even 10 by 10 magic squares.

64
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:37,275
So as we can see, apart from the 3 by 3 magic square found on the tortoise,

65
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:41,684
There are many much larger magic squares.

66
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,040
Western mathematicicians, too,

67
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,002
delved into the secrets of magic squares.

68
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,707
There was even a famous engraving

69
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:50,495
named Melancolia I.

70
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:55,829
In the top-right corner of the engraving, there is a 4 by 4 magic square.

71
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,056
Let's examine carefully

72
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:00,537
this 4 by 4 magic square.

73
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,172
In the two squares in the middle of the last row,

74
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,981
one holds a 15 and the other 14.

75
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,624
This demonstrates the cleverness of the artist,

76
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:14,254
for this engraving dates backs back to 1514.

77
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:17,234
So it can be seen that the secrets behind the ordering in magic squares

78
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:21,097
are almost beyond the imagination of mankind,

79
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:25,712
and some feel that magic squares harbour secrets of the universe.

80
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,488
For precisely this reason, in many religions,

81
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:30,843
magic squares hold special symbolic significance.

82
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:38,011
Even within their temples, magic squares are carved onto the walls.

83
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,670
So if we are to study magic squares,

84
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,074
We must first give them a formal definition,

85
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,313
a prerequisite for any rigorous mathematical investigation.

86
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:48,064
First we must have an n by n grid.

87
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:52,054
shall put the numbers 1, 2, 3...

88
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:54,698
all the way up to n squared

89
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:57,723
into the n by n grid.

90
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:02,510
We must guarantee that for every row and column,

91
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,268
and even for its diagonals,

92
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:09,108
the sum of the relevant numbers are identical.

93
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:11,963
So for a magic square of arbitrary size,

94
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,433
in order to study it,

95
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:17,973
we must first calculate the sum on the rows, columns and diagonals.

96
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:21,141
So we define the sum of each row

97
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:22,465
and each column

98
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:25,252
and each diagonal

99
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,057
to be the magic sum (or magic constant).

100
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:30,892
Let's denote this sum by the lowercase letter s.

101
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:33,178
Then for a magic square of size n,

102
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:37,029
if we wish to calculate s...

103
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:39,928
Well, what's the sum of all the numbers from

104
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,945
1, 2, 3

105
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,721
all the way up to n^2?

106
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:44,039
There is a formula for this:

107
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,698
the sum of 1+2+3+...all the way up to n^2

108
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:52,377
is equal to n^2(n^2+1)/2

109
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:53,858
but this number

110
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,985
is precisely n times s.

111
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:01,695
So the magic sum of the magic square is equal to 

112
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:04,079
n^2(n^2+1)/2

113
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,647
divided by n

114
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,696
Now, for a magic square of size n,

115
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:12,315
We know the magic sum should be equal to

116
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:15,921
n(n^2+1)/2

117
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,351
Since for every natural number n,

118
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,635
we can calculate its magic sum,

119
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:24,236
then is it true for all n that we can just arrange the numbers from 1 to n^2

120
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:28,713
and put them into an n by n grid

121
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,151
to form a magic square?

122
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,053
Let's use a simple example

123
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:36,575
of when n equals 2.

124
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:39,821
Does there exist a magic square of size 2?

125
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:46,705
How do we put the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 into a 2 by 2 grid

126
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:52,551
so that the sum of every row and column are identical?

127
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,045
We first assume there does indeed 

128
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,368
exist a magic square of size 2.

129
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:58,940
Then the following must be true.

130
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,530
Let us use the letters a, b, c, d to denote the entries in the grid,

131
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,721
If there exists a 2 by 2 magic square,

132
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,306
what is its magic sum?

133
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:09,627
Substitution into our formula

134
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:14,742
reveals that the magic sum is should be equal to 2(2*2+1)/2,

135
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:16,725
which is exactly equal to 5.

136
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:17,920
This means that

137
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,524
in this configuration of a, b, c & d,

138
00:07:21,644 --> 00:07:25,277
horizontally a+b should be equal to 5,

139
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:28,740
the second row c+d should be equal to 5,

140
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,449
and diagonally, both a+d and c+b should be equal to 5.

141
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,781
But now we spot a problem.

142
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:40,384
If we take the difference between c+b and c+d
143
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,095
we obtain this result:

144
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:44,631
b-d=0

145
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:49,393
However, we know that the four numbers we picked, 

146
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:51,224
are each distinct and cannot be equal to any other.

147
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:53,044
This is from the definition of a magic square.

148
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:55,533
So we have arrived at a contradiction and our assumption must be false.

149
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:59,619
So a magic square of size 2 does not exist.

150
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:03,504
But just now we have seen examples of magic squares of size 3, 4, 5

151
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:06,684
and even of size 10.

152
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,507
So what is the real answer to the question of existence?

153
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:11,491
In fact, roughly thirty years ago,

154
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,170
a German mathematician

155
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,268
proved that 

156
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:17,812
it is always possible to construct a magic square 

157
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:21,565
of size N, for every N larger or equal to 3.

158
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:25,688
Since magic squares exist for N larger than 2,

159
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:27,388
We quite naturally wonder,

160
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:31,694
how do we construct a magic square?

161
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:36,071
Actually Hui Yang introduced, in his book, a method

162
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:38,791
of constructing a magic square of size 3.

163
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:44,751
He first arranged the numbers 1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9 in diagonals.

164
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:48,449
then exchanged the numbers on opposing corners,

165
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,728
finally forming a 3 by 3 grid thus.

166
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:55,127
The result is a 3 by 3 magic square.

167
00:08:55,247 --> 00:09:00,640
but this method is only applicable to 3 by 3 magic squares.

168
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,315
It was only in the seventeenth century

169
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:08,204
did a French mathematician discover

170
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:12,119
how to construct larger magic squares.

171
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:15,018
Of course, his technique had its own limitations.

172
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,940
He could only create odd-sized magic squares.

173
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,327
What, then, was his approach?

174
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:21,572
In fact he first imagined

175
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:24,072
an N by N grid like this,

176
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:26,357
to not be flat.

177
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:29,783
He filled the grid up in a fashion akin to going around the globe.

178
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,542
At the same time, when he places the numbers,

179
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:37,924
he always goes from bottom left to top right.

180
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:42,022
Next, let us demonstrate this method with a 3 by 3 square.

181
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:44,812
Next we'll use this device to introduce to everyone

182
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,410
the construction of a 3 by 3 magic square.

183
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,410
The first step in the method

184
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,480
is that we put a 1 in the middle of the first row.

185
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,126
Th process goes like this. If we pretend 

186
00:09:56,246 --> 00:10:00,827
we're moving a piece from the bottom left to the top right,

187
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:01,819
But during this process,

188
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,362
it might be moved out of bounds.

189
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:07,060
We can make further progress by pretending

190
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,099
the edges are conjoined; going off one edge means coming on to the opposite.

191
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:16,396
Simply moving the piece to its second position

192
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,426
will cause it to fall off the edge of the board.

193
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:19,276
However, since going off one edge means coming onto the opposite one,

194
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:21,607
it should actually arrive at this position

195
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:24,487
So 2 should be placed here.

196
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,340
3 will be in the next position.

197
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,429
If the opposite edges are also conjoined in this direction,

198
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:33,334
then 3 should be placed here.

199
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,767
According to the rule of moving from the bottom left to top right,

200
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,091
We find that moving to the next position from 3 will cause

201
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,914
us to move to where 1 is.

202
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,077
Now this is a special case:

203
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:46,839
if the next position is already occupied or ,

204
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,220
we place the piece immediately below the previous square.

205
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,514
Therefore, 4 should be place here.

206
00:10:55,634 --> 00:11:01,399
After this, we try to find the positions for 5 and 6 following the rule.

207
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,976
We don't have to do anything special until 7,

208
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,828
when the next position will go off the board.

209
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,091
By observing that 7

210
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:10,407
be placed at this position in the corner,

211
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:12,865
which is already occupied,

212
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:17,490
so we must move to the square immediately below the previous square.

213
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:23,208
Next, it's time to find the position of 8 from 7;

214
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,191
we see that it should be here due to the conjoined edges.

215
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,468
Finally, our last square is reserved for 9.

216
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:32,082
Thus if we now verify the sums:

217
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:35,360
8+1+6 8+5+2...

218
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,127
The sum of any row, column or diagonal

219
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:42,106
comes exactly to the magic sum of 15.

220
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:45,665
Since we know how to construct odd-sized magic squares,

221
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,349
then everyone must be wondering

222
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:49,477
whether, for a magic square of arbitrary size,

223
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,986
there is a corresponding method?

224
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:55,982
In fact, we can divide magic squares into three classes:

225
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:58,043
the first class comprises odd-sized magic squares,

226
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:00,416
the second magic squares of size 4m

227
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:03,035
and the third magic squares of size 4m+2.

228
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,745
Each class has its own method (of constructing magic squares).

229
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:08,549
So by now,

230
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,385
if we are given any n,

231
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:16,343
we can construct a corresponding n by n magic square.

232
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:18,984
But if we go back to the earlier 

233
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:22,397
3 by 3 magic square constructed using Hui Yang's method,

234
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:26,845
when we compare it with the magic square we just constructed,

235
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:29,435
are the two the same?

236
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:32,789
At first sight, these two arrangements are different.

237
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:34,426
However, a careful inspection reveals that

238
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,656
if we rotate this magic square

239
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,839
we obtain two identical magic squares.

240
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,594
That was a 3 by 3 magic square.

241
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:45,798
Let's now move on to 4 by 4 magic squares.

242
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:50,979
Here is the magic square from the engraving.

243
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:56,730
This magic square we're seeing was carved next to a temple.

244
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,952
Although they are both 4 by 4 magic squares,

245
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:03,000
no matter how you rotate or flip, their arrangements

246
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,555
are not the same.

247
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:07,776
This leads to the question,

248
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:09,567
if we take a magic square of size n (n>2),

249
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:14,015
how many distinct magic squares can we generate?

250
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:18,076
In fact, the counting of magic squares has long perplexed people.

251
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,353
We know that no magic square of size 2 exists.

252
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:26,503
If discount flips and rotations, then for a 3 by 3 magic square,

253
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:28,548
there is only one possibility.

254
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:30,565
Once we are up to 4 by 4 ,

255
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,842
there are 880 distinct arrangements.

256
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:36,745
If we allow for flips and rotations,

257
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,512
there are 7040 possibilities.

258
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,024
For 5 by 5 magic squares, then,

259
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:42,337
we can all imagine

260
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,366
how many 5 by 5 magic square should be.

261
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:48,896
There are already over 270 million 5 by 5 magic squares.

262
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,817
Exactly how many 6 by 6 magic squares should be,

263
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,723
is beyond our ability to calculate.

264
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:56,437
Even computers are incapable of enumerating all the possibilities.

265
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:59,569
Mathematicians,

266
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:03,030
determined that it must be within a certain range,

267
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,286
roughly 1.77x10^19.

268
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:11,093
What about magic squares of size 7?

269
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,597
No one really knows
270
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:15,916
Even the range in which it lies,

271
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:17,693
we do not know.

272
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:22,424
Thus we can see how difficult counting is.

273
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:26,332
So is this the greatest extent of research into magic squares?

274
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:30,341
Actually we have only come across ordinary magic squares so far.

275
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:32,999
There are many other forms.

276
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,804
We can consider an arbitrary number sequences;

277
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:39,948
neither do we need limit all the numbers to a consecutive sequence,

278
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:43,118
nor do we have to use ordinary numbers.

279
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:47,459
We can even put various prime numbers in the grid

280
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,845
to construct a magic square.

281
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:51,258
Some people have even said that

282
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,268
OK, the sum for each row and each column

283
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:54,351
is identical.

284
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:59,906
In fact there are a number of people trying to form magic squares,

285
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,314
where the product of each row and column is identical.

286
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,565
These also make for a special form of magic squares.

287
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:07,577
Magic squares are so great,

288
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,933
they have attracted the fascination of the world at large.

289
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,701
In the year 1977,

290
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:14,368
magic squares, as a symbol of the intelligence of mankind,

291
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,222
were transported into the space.

292
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:21,715
At the same time, I found that elegant constructions like magic squares,

293
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:25,916
in fact also offer a special way of expressing yourself.

294
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:29,122
In fact, during the 2008,

295
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:31,885
A headline attracted my attention:

296
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:38,116
a 78-year-old farmer designed a very elegent magic square.

297
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:40,410
It is a cube, 

298
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,446
where its every diagonal

299
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:49,261
and even its every row and column each add up to equal 2008.

300
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,363
"Unfurling" this cube onto a plane

301
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,086
produces a heart-like shape.

302
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,642
Moreover, at each corner, taking the sum of 5 numbers in a cross

303
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:59,265
and subtracting the number on the opposite corner (on the same face)

304
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,915
is exactly 2008.

305
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:05,997
So Mr Zhongxiang Bao spent three entire years

306
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:08,937
designing this perfect magic square

307
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:11,061
to honour the Olympics.

308
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:16,337
The development of magic squares allow you to let loose your imagination

309
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:19,637
The study of magic squares is both rich and profound.

310
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:24,573
In combinatorics there are many similar sophisticated structures.

311
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:29,002
Just now we covered some of the development of combinatorics 

312
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,283
in China (or even the East).

313
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,709
We must be eager to learn more

314
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:34,884
regarding the West.

315
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,521
How did combinatorics begin and develop

316
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:41,291
in the West?

317
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,942
So in the next lesson, we shall begin a deep discussion about the development of combinatorics in the West.
