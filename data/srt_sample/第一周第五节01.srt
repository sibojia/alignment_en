1
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:14,726
In this lesson, we shall learn

2
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,160
how to do well in combinatorics.

3
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,965
Essentially, the problem of how to count well.

4
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:25,003
Everyone knows the fundamental concept behind counting.

5
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:28,084
We simply count one by one.

6
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:31,992
In computing, there is a rather more elegant term for this:

7
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:37,826
enumeration - to highlight its enumerative nature,

8
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:40,300
we in fact call it
9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,712
brute-force enumeration.

10
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:45,504
By its name, we can tell

11
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:49,655
that it's not an overly efficient method.

12
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:52,511
The thinking behind brute-force enumeration

13
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:57,683
is to count every single one of the possible solutions in turn.

14
00:00:57,803 --> 00:01:01,918
In theory, it can solve all counting problems.

15
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:04,071
Of course, saying it works in theory

16
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:08,953
implies that it often fails in practice.

17
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:11,942
Let's see a simple example.

18
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:15,231
There's a football World Cup this year(2014).

19
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,116
Many students may encounter an awkward problem:

20
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:24,336
So many matches, right in the middle of exam season, what should I do?

21
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:28,172
Even if we refrain from watching the group-stage matches,

22
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:33,190
we can't bear to miss the elimination rounds. But how many of those are there?

23
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,877
We should plan out our time in advance.

24
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,422
So let's see,

25
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:43,841
In fact, we have to count how many elimination matches there are altogether.

26
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,249
Only 16 teams attending the World Cup

27
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,215
will advance to the knockout rounds.

28
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,705
The tournament system becomes very harsh:

29
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:56,605
single elimination, pitting two teams head-to-head,

30
00:01:56,725 --> 00:02:00,183
with only the winner proceeding to the next round,

31
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:01,784
until the champion is decided.

32
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:05,039
How many matches have to be played in this process?

33
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,555
Let's think about it carefully first,

34
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,042
and then have a little quiz as following.
