1
00:00:01,192 --> 00:00:03,685
I think we've all thought about it long and hard.

2
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:06,695
How did you arrive at your answer?

3
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:10,908
Suppose we want to have all the nations of the world

4
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:13,540
participating in the World Cup elimination stage.

5
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:17,969
So if there are 224 teams proceeding to the elimination stage,

6
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:20,457
how many matches will be played?


7
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:24,733
So how did everyone


8
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,060
solve the quiz problem?

9
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,955
Perhaps you drew a very complicated decision tree,

10
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:33,809
and counted up all the nodes to find out the solution.

11
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:38,352
If there are now 224 nations in the knockout matches,

12
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:40,473
will you still count like this?

13
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:43,675
How large must your decision tree be?

14
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,696
Is there a better way?

15
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:47,837
Let's try to get to the solution quickly.

16
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:49,910
If we reconsider the problem,


17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,165
it's actually saying that in every match,


18
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:58,203
there has to be a winner and a loser,

19
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:04,933
with the loser being eliminated. How many ultimately remain?

20
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:08,125
Only the champion is left standing.

21
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:11,884
Every match corresponds to an eliminated team.

22
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:14,100
So the number of teams eliminated

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,977
is equal to the number of matches!

24
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:21,711
If out of 16 teams, we have to eliminate 15,

25
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:24,506
then there has to be 15 matches.


26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,649
Now with 224 nations participating,


27
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:32,628
we need to eliminate 223 teams in total.

28
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:37,601
Then naturally 223 matches have to be played.


29
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,202
This problem no longer requires us to 

30
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:42,480
draw up such a complicated decision tree.

31
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,320
We use a one-to-one correspondence


32
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:50,713
to show that if there are n teams participating

33
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:54,929
then we need exactly n-1 elimination matches.

34
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:57,282
This one-to-one correspondence (injectivity)

35
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:01,116
demonstrates that brute-force enumeration is not always necessary.

36
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:03,466
We can use a degree of abstraction

37
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:05,857
to generate an ingenious idea,

38
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,867
which might make the problem wonderfully simple.
