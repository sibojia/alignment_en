1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:03,139
Next we'll introduce to everyone

2
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:08,096
a famous problem known as the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg.


3
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:13,901
Konigsberg is a city in Prussia with breathtaking scenery.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,716
This city is very charming.

5
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,979
If we look into its colourful history, we shall find

6
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:28,082
that it was the birthplace of many great mathematicians and philosophers.

7
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,001
The philosopher Kant and mathematician Goldbach 

8
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,074
were both born here.

9
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:40,139
Apart from the great thinkers it has produced, of especial note is the

10
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:43,538
river passing through Konigsberg.

11
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:47,182
The river branches into two in the city,

12
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,743
splitting the city into four pieces.

13
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:53,814
To connect together the islands and other parts of the city,

14
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:57,329
seven bridges were built over the river.

15
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:03,134
Yet the distribution of the seven bridges is very interesting.

16
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:06,679
So in Konigsberg,

17
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:09,915
the locals enjoy an interesting game:

18
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:13,455
When they are strolling on the seven bridges -

19
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:18,112
which seem to connect everything together -

20
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:23,462
they would try to cross over all the bridges exactly once.

21
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:26,120
This problem of traversing all seven bridges

22
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:30,294
is the notable "Seven Bridges of Konigsberg".

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,419
We might think here,

24
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:35,178
so what? It's only crossing all the bridges,

25
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:39,402
so let's just enumerate all the permutations by brute force.

26
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,598
Since no repetitions are allowed,


27
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:48,118
so we are simply limited to permutations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, right?

28
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,199
How many permutations of 7 numbers are there?

29
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,258
7!=5040 different solutions.

30
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:58,520
But there are many false solutions contained there.

31
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:02,090
For example, it might be impossible to go directly from one bridge to another.

32
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,102
A permutation like this would not be a valid solution.

33
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:12,257
Say you physically attempt all 5040 possible solutions.

34
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:14,640
If you actually try and walk out one possible solution a day,

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,196
You'll need 13 years to try them all.

36
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:22,809
This problem became a very popular topic, which Konigsbergers loved to

37
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:24,391
analyse in their free time.

38
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:30,539
At that time, several undergraduates found it a very interesting problem,

39
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:34,838
Yet, try as they might,

40
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,025
they couldn't find a valid solution.

41
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:42,644
So they emulated Goldbach and penned a letter to Euler.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,078
Euler is certainly a master of his craft. He discovered after several trials

43
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,739
that there doesn't seem to be any valid solutions.

44
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,487
So he changed tack

45
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:56,113
and considered the possibility that it was impossible


46
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:58,884
to traverse all seven bridges exactly once.

47
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:03,980
Euler only needed several days to solve this difficult problem.

48
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:07,844
His answer? O solutions.

49
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,709
How did he accomplish this?

50
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:15,268
He certainly didn't use complete enumeration.

51
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:20,410
He didn't even label all the bridges 1, 2, 3, ... 7.

52
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:23,086
Instead he conducted a magnificent method.

53
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:28,276
He converted the seven bridges to a graph,


54
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,088
with the landmasses as nodes

55
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,319
and the bridges as the edges between the nodes.

56
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:39,252
This graph, with the seven edges,

57
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:42,665
exactly corresponds with the seven bridges of Konigsberg.

58
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,167
Wishing to traverse all seven bridges exactly once

59
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:53,300
is equivalent to asking if it's possible, on this graph,


60
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,512
to draw out all the edges in a single stroke.

61
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,965
This abstraction by Euler is very neat.

62
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,720
He abstracted the original problem into a graph,

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,575
which he then transformed into a one-stroke problem.

64
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:12,984
Euler eventually wrote a very well known paper,

65
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,001
which is often regarded as the beginning of topology.

66
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:20,767
In 1736 he published the first paper in the world

67
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,326
about graph theory,

68
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,731
which discussed the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg.

69
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:27,316
He not only employed abstraction,

70
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:30,751
but simultaneously proved the necessary and sufficient condition


71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,246
for drawing out the graph

72
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:36,902
in a single stroke.

73
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,862
First you need all the nodes to be connected.

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,287
Aside from this he classified all the nodes into two types,


75
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:48,780
according to the number of edges adjacent the node. If the number is odd,

76
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,227
the node is an odd node.

77
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:54,540
Else, if the number of adjacent edges is even, the node is even.

78
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,937
So a necessary sufficient condition for a graph

79
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,020
to be drawable in a single stroke:

80
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:05,626
the number of odd nodes must either be 0 or 2.


81
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,388
Let's return to the graph of Konigsberg's Seven Bridges.


82
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,258
Does it satisfy the previous condition?

83
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,517
This graph has four nodes,

84
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,932
with every node being connected to

85
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,766
3 or 5 edges.


86
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:29,360
Therefore all 4 nodes are odd.


87
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:31,964
The necessary and sufficient condition for being able

88
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:35,482
to draw this graph in a single stroke states

89
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:39,791
that the number of odd nodes must either be 0 or 2.

90
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,937
Clearly the Seven Bridges do not satisfy this condition,


91
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:49,126
So Euler didn't need 13 years to walk out all the solutions,

92
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,774
but simply state there is no solution

93
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,992
that traverses all seven bridges exactly once.




94
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:58,860
With the passing of time, 


95
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,865
the problem gradually faded from people's minds.

96
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,398
Yet the story continues,

97
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:11,856
Some bridges were retired from service for want of repairs.

98
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:16,271
Now we can see that the nature of the graph has changed.

99
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:21,242
For example, if we remove this edge at the corner,


100
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:26,460
we find that the number of odd nodes has been reduced by 2,

101
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:28,977
with only 2 odd nodes remaining.

102
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,574
Now Euler's condition regarding the

103
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,577
single-stroke problem is satisfied.


104
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:40,406
Since there exists a solution,


105
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:41,951
we might quite naturally ask next

106
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,864
how many solutions are there to

107
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:49,813
traverse all six bridges exactly once?

108
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:56,604
This problem seems to be a generalisation of Euler's problem.


109
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:59,747
In Euler's paper,he not only stated

110
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,907
the necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a solution,

111
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:05,238
but presented us with a general guiding principle.

112
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:08,361
He stated that to solve the problem,

113
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:12,412
then one possibility is that there are 0 odd nodes.

114
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:15,059
This means that all the nodes are even.

115
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:18,127
When this occurs,

116
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,731
and you want to complete a graph in one stroke,

117
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,449
you can start from any even node,

118
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:25,339
and at the end return to it.

119
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,813
Should you have 2 odd nodes however,

120
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,666
you must begin from one odd node,

121
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,001
and end up at the other.

122
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:41,313
With these two conditions, we discover that

123
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:46,049
to find all the solutions traversing all six bridges exactly once,

124
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:49,778
we do not need to resort to complete enumeration.

125
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,855
This is because we already know

126
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:55,194
that if there are only two odd nodes,

127
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,371
then we have to start from an odd node and

128
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,707
end up at the other odd node.

129
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,605
In fact, in the field of computer algorithms

130
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:08,166
this traversal of all edges exactly once


131
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:10,442
is a special problem of its own.

132
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:12,982
In fact, solutions to this problem are named after Euler:

133
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,790
we call them Eulerian paths.

134
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:20,688
So how many Eulerian paths are there in total?

135
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:22,726
If we code up

136
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:25,835
a fast and efficient algorithm,

137
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,689
then we shall discover

138
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:32,809
that we are basically still using enumeration.

139
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,627
However, it doesn't seem to be quite so brute-force.

140
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:39,020
In the traditional sense of brute-force enumeration,

141
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,475
we mean that all possible solutions are listed.

142
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,187
But here, due to Euler's work,

143
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:49,838
we can use his theorem to deduce the solutions.

144
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,738
We discover that the process becomes simpler and much more natural.

145
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:59,360
Therefore, even though enumeration is a basic principle in counting,

146
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,921
abstraction makes it really powerful.

147
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,607
Under many circumstances, without a computer,

148
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:11,431
a human's capacity for enumeration is very limited.

149
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:15,424
Combinatorics uses this mode of thought

150
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:18,812
to instruct computers to use abstract methods,

151
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:23,904
to make the enumerative process that much more elegant and concise.

152
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:28,142
This is the magic behind combinatorics.
