1
00:00:00,948 --> 00:00:02,977
After this period of study,

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:06,939
we now understand that much of combinatorics is counting.

3
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:10,126
its goals are

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,672
twofold.

5
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:13,872
Nothing should be repeated or missed.

6
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:17,599
In fact counting is not as simple as we'd all like to think,

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,510
because of the sheer size of the dataset we're facing.

8
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:23,808
Moreover, the elements of the dataset have complex relations.

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,798
So to count well, to study combinatorics well,

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,544
we require some skill with abstraction.

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,662
Some of the methods used in combinatorics are not all that deep,

12
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:41,745
but some brilliant ideas involved allow us to logically partition cases. 

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,891
We need to grasp how to change our perspective.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,924
So combinatorics is indeed a very attractive field.
