so
can
we
tell
what
this
is
this
is
one
of
the
earliest
examples
of
combinatorics
magic
squares
combinatorics
is
an
ancient
field
its
history
may
be
traced
back
over
four
thousand
years
to
the
age
of
the
great
yu
according
to
chinese
myth
the
great
yu
tamed
the
yellow
river
there
is
a
legend
that
says
while
working
to
tame
the
river
the
great
yu
was
very
worried
one
day
he
was
strolling
by
the
riverbank
when
a
giant
tortoise
rose
from
the
yellow
river
this
tortoise
was
not
only
huge
but
even
more
amazingly
there
were
mysterious
patterns
on
its
back
if
we
study
the
patterns
carefully
we
discover
that
its
back
is
divided
up
into
nine
squares
each
square
contains
a
number
of
dots
if
we
add
up
the
dots
of
each
row
or
of
all
columns
or
even
of
each
diagonal
all
add
up
to
fifteen
fifteen
is
quite
a
special
number
in
the
chinese
lunar
calendar
since
solar
terms
last
fifteen
days
each
so
the
great
yu
was
inspired
by
this
mysterious
pattern
and
divided
the
work
accordingly
into
fifteen
days
periods
magic
squares
appear
not
only
in
ancient
literature
but
even
in
well
known
works
in
film
and
television
they
appear
frequently
next
we'll
watch
a
short
clip
from
the
legend
of
the
condor
heroes
ying
gu
who
lives
in
the
cabin
by
the
black
swamp
was
studying
how
to
form
a
3x3
magic
square
yet
over
a
decade
passed
and
she
still
could
not
reach
a
perfect
solution
until
rong
huang
came
to
the
cabin
that
was
your
arithmetic
obviously
bests
me
but
let
me
ask
you
separate
the
numbers
one
to
nine
into
three
columns
so
that
for
every
row
column
and
diagonal
the
sum
of
the
three
numbers
is
fifteen
how
to
order
the
numbers
magic
square
of
nine
use
the
method
of
the
tortoise
two
and
four
the
shoulders
six
and
eight
the
feet
three
left
seven
right
nine
top
and
one
bottom
five
in
the
middle
i
thought
i
created
this
magic
formula
but
little
did
i
suspect
that
it
is
laid
down
in
verse
then
how
do
you
transform
each
square
into
eight
diagrams
eight
times
nine
is
seventy
two
for
the
numbers
from
one
to
seventy
two
encircle
the
nine
squares
with
eight
numbers
each
time
with
four
circles
at
the
intersections
altogether
there
are
thirteen
circles
the
sum
of
the
numbers
in
each
circle
comes
to
two
hundred
and
ninety
two
this
is
the
magic
of
the
graph
from
the
book
of
luo
you
won't
understand
anyway
so
is
it
really
as
commonplace
as
rong
huang
says
in
fact
the
first
person
to
investigate
magic
squares
should
be
the
mathematician
hui
yang
from
the
southern
song
dynasty
in
china
pascal's
triangle
is
actually
named
hui
yang's
triangle
aside
from
this
he
authored
the
very
interesting
mathematical
treatise
classic
algorithms
within
he
detailed
three
by
three
four
by
four
five
by
five
and
even
ten
by
ten
magic
squares
so
as
we
can
see
apart
from
the
three
by
three
magic
square
found
on
the
tortoise
there
are
many
much
larger
magic
squares
western
mathematicicians
too
delved
into
the
secrets
of
magic
squares
there
was
even
a
famous
engraving
named
melancolia
i
in
the
top
right
corner
of
the
engraving
there
is
a
four
by
four
magic
square
let's
examine
carefully
this
four
by
four
magic
square
in
the
two
squares
in
the
middle
of
the
last
row
one
holds
a
fifteen
and
the
other
fourteen
this
demonstrates
the
cleverness
of
the
artist
for
this
engraving
dates
backs
back
to
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
fourteen
so
it
can
be
seen
that
the
secrets
behind
the
ordering
in
magic
squares
are
almost
beyond
the
imagination
of
mankind
and
some
feel
that
magic
squares
harbour
secrets
of
the
universe
for
precisely
this
reason
in
many
religions
magic
squares
hold
special
symbolic
significance
even
within
their
temples
magic
squares
are
carved
onto
the
walls
so
if
we
are
to
study
magic
squares
we
must
first
give
them
a
formal
definition
a
prerequisite
for
any
rigorous
mathematical
investigation
first
we
must
have
an
n
by
n
grid
shall
put
the
numbers
one
two
three
all
the
way
up
to
n
squared
into
the
n
by
n
grid
we
must
guarantee
that
for
every
row
and
column
and
even
for
its
diagonals
the
sum
of
the
relevant
numbers
are
identical
so
for
a
magic
square
of
arbitrary
size
in
order
to
study
it
we
must
first
calculate
the
sum
on
the
rows
columns
and
diagonals
so
we
define
the
sum
of
each
row
and
each
column
and
each
diagonal
to
be
the
magic
sum
or
magic
constant
let's
denote
this
sum
by
the
lowercase
letter
s
then
for
a
magic
square
of
size
n
if
we
wish
to
calculate
s
well
what's
the
sum
of
all
the
numbers
from
one
two
three
all
the
way
up
to
n^2
there
is
a
formula
for
this
the
sum
of
1+2+3+...all
the
way
up
to
n^2
is
equal
to
n^2(n^2+1)/2
but
this
number
is
precisely
n
times
s
so
the
magic
sum
of
the
magic
square
is
equal
to
n^2(n^2+1)/2
divided
by
n
now
for
a
magic
square
of
size
n
we
know
the
magic
sum
should
be
equal
to
n(n^2+1)/2
since
for
every
natural
number
n
we
can
calculate
its
magic
sum
then
is
it
true
for
all
n
that
we
can
just
arrange
the
numbers
from
one
to
n^2
and
put
them
into
an
n
by
n
grid
to
form
a
magic
square
let's
use
a
simple
example
of
when
n
equals
two
does
there
exist
a
magic
square
of
size
two
how
do
we
put
the
numbers
one
two
three
four
into
a
two
by
two
grid
so
that
the
sum
of
every
row
and
column
are
identical
we
first
assume
there
does
indeed
exist
a
magic
square
of
size
two
then
the
following
must
be
true
let
us
use
the
letters
a
b
c
d
to
denote
the
entries
in
the
grid
if
there
exists
a
two
by
two
magic
square
what
is
its
magic
sum
substitution
into
our
formula
reveals
that
the
magic
sum
is
should
be
equal
to
2(2*2+1)/2
which
is
exactly
equal
to
five
this
means
that
in
this
configuration
of
a
b
c
&
d
horizontally
a+b
should
be
equal
to
five
the
second
row
c+d
should
be
equal
to
five
and
diagonally
both
a+d
and
c+b
should
be
equal
to
five
but
now
we
spot
a
problem
if
we
take
the
difference
between
c+b
and
c+d
we
obtain
this
result
b
d=0
however
we
know
that
the
four
numbers
we
picked
are
each
distinct
and
cannot
be
equal
to
any
other
this
is
from
the
definition
of
a
magic
square
so
we
have
arrived
at
a
contradiction
and
our
assumption
must
be
false
so
a
magic
square
of
size
two
does
not
exist
but
just
now
we
have
seen
examples
of
magic
squares
of
size
three
four
five
and
even
of
size
ten
so
what
is
the
real
answer
to
the
question
of
existence
in
fact
roughly
thirty
years
ago
a
german
mathematician
proved
that
it
is
always
possible
to
construct
a
magic
square
of
size
n
for
every
n
larger
or
equal
to
three
since
magic
squares
exist
for
n
larger
than
two
we
quite
naturally
wonder
how
do
we
construct
a
magic
square
actually
hui
yang
introduced
in
his
book
a
method
of
constructing
a
magic
square
of
size
three
he
first
arranged
the
numbers
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
in
diagonals
then
exchanged
the
numbers
on
opposing
corners
finally
forming
a
three
by
three
grid
thus
the
result
is
a
three
by
three
magic
square
but
this
method
is
only
applicable
to
three
by
three
magic
squares
it
was
only
in
the
seventeenth
century
did
a
french
mathematician
discover
how
to
construct
larger
magic
squares
of
course
his
technique
had
its
own
limitations
he
could
only
create
odd
sized
magic
squares
what
then
was
his
approach
in
fact
he
first
imagined
an
n
by
n
grid
like
this
to
not
be
flat
he
filled
the
grid
up
in
a
fashion
akin
to
going
around
the
globe
at
the
same
time
when
he
places
the
numbers
he
always
goes
from
bottom
left
to
top
right
next
let
us
demonstrate
this
method
with
a
three
by
three
square
next
we'll
use
this
device
to
introduce
to
everyone
the
construction
of
a
three
by
three
magic
square
the
first
step
in
the
method
is
that
we
put
a
one
in
the
middle
of
the
first
row
th
process
goes
like
this
if
we
pretend
we're
moving
a
piece
from
the
bottom
left
to
the
top
right
but
during
this
process
it
might
be
moved
out
of
bounds
we
can
make
further
progress
by
pretending
the
edges
are
conjoined
going
off
one
edge
means
coming
on
to
the
opposite
simply
moving
the
piece
to
its
second
position
will
cause
it
to
fall
off
the
edge
of
the
board
however
since
going
off
one
edge
means
coming
onto
the
opposite
one
it
should
actually
arrive
at
this
position
so
two
should
be
placed
here
three
will
be
in
the
next
position
if
the
opposite
edges
are
also
conjoined
in
this
direction
then
three
should
be
placed
here
according
to
the
rule
of
moving
from
the
bottom
left
to
top
right
we
find
that
moving
to
the
next
position
from
three
will
cause
us
to
move
to
where
one
is
now
this
is
a
special
case
if
the
next
position
is
already
occupied
or
we
place
the
piece
immediately
below
the
previous
square
therefore
four
should
be
place
here
after
this
we
try
to
find
the
positions
for
five
and
six
following
the
rule
we
don't
have
to
do
anything
special
until
seven
when
the
next
position
will
go
off
the
board
by
observing
that
seven
be
placed
at
this
position
in
the
corner
which
is
already
occupied
so
we
must
move
to
the
square
immediately
below
the
previous
square
next
it's
time
to
find
the
position
of
eight
from
seven
we
see
that
it
should
be
here
due
to
the
conjoined
edges
finally
our
last
square
is
reserved
for
nine
thus
if
we
now
verify
the
sums
8+1+6
8+5+2
the
sum
of
any
row
column
or
diagonal
comes
exactly
to
the
magic
sum
of
fifteen
since
we
know
how
to
construct
odd
sized
magic
squares
then
everyone
must
be
wondering
whether
for
a
magic
square
of
arbitrary
size
there
is
a
corresponding
method
in
fact
we
can
divide
magic
squares
into
three
classes
the
first
class
comprises
odd
sized
magic
squares
the
second
magic
squares
of
size
4m
and
the
third
magic
squares
of
size
4m+2
each
class
has
its
own
method
of
constructing
magic
squares
so
by
now
if
we
are
given
any
n
we
can
construct
a
corresponding
n
by
n
magic
square
but
if
we
go
back
to
the
earlier
three
by
three
magic
square
constructed
using
hui
yang's
method
when
we
compare
it
with
the
magic
square
we
just
constructed
are
the
two
the
same
at
first
sight
these
two
arrangements
are
different
however
a
careful
inspection
reveals
that
if
we
rotate
this
magic
square
we
obtain
two
identical
magic
squares
that
was
a
three
by
three
magic
square
let's
now
move
on
to
four
by
four
magic
squares
here
is
the
magic
square
from
the
engraving
this
magic
square
we're
seeing
was
carved
next
to
a
temple
although
they
are
both
four
by
four
magic
squares
no
matter
how
you
rotate
or
flip
their
arrangements
are
not
the
same
this
leads
to
the
question
if
we
take
a
magic
square
of
size
n
n>2
how
many
distinct
magic
squares
can
we
generate
in
fact
the
counting
of
magic
squares
has
long
perplexed
people
we
know
that
no
magic
square
of
size
two
exists
if
discount
flips
and
rotations
then
for
a
three
by
three
magic
square
there
is
only
one
possibility
once
we
are
up
to
four
by
four
there
are
eight
hundred
and
eighty
distinct
arrangements
if
we
allow
for
flips
and
rotations
there
are
seven
thousand
and
forty
possibilities
for
five
by
five
magic
squares
then
we
can
all
imagine
how
many
five
by
five
magic
square
should
be
there
are
already
over
two
hundred
and
seventy
million
five
by
five
magic
squares
exactly
how
many
six
by
six
magic
squares
should
be
is
beyond
our
ability
to
calculate
even
computers
are
incapable
of
enumerating
all
the
possibilities
mathematicians
determined
that
it
must
be
within
a
certain
range
roughly
1.77x10^19
what
about
magic
squares
of
size
seven
no
one
really
knows
even
the
range
in
which
it
lies
we
do
not
know
thus
we
can
see
how
difficult
counting
is
so
is
this
the
greatest
extent
of
research
into
magic
squares
actually
we
have
only
come
across
ordinary
magic
squares
so
far
there
are
many
other
forms
we
can
consider
an
arbitrary
number
sequences
neither
do
we
need
limit
all
the
numbers
to
a
consecutive
sequence
nor
do
we
have
to
use
ordinary
numbers
we
can
even
put
various
prime
numbers
in
the
grid
to
construct
a
magic
square
some
people
have
even
said
that
ok
the
sum
for
each
row
and
each
column
is
identical
in
fact
there
are
a
number
of
people
trying
to
form
magic
squares
where
the
product
of
each
row
and
column
is
identical
these
also
make
for
a
special
form
of
magic
squares
magic
squares
are
so
great
they
have
attracted
the
fascination
of
the
world
at
large
in
the
year
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
seventy
seven
magic
squares
as
a
symbol
of
the
intelligence
of
mankind
were
transported
into
the
space
at
the
same
time
i
found
that
elegant
constructions
like
magic
squares
in
fact
also
offer
a
special
way
of
expressing
yourself
in
fact
during
the
two
thousand
and
eight
a
headline
attracted
my
attention
a
seventy
eight
year
old
farmer
designed
a
very
elegent
magic
square
it
is
a
cube
where
its
every
diagonal
and
even
its
every
row
and
column
each
add
up
to
equal
two
thousand
and
eight
unfurling
this
cube
onto
a
plane
produces
a
heart
like
shape
moreover
at
each
corner
taking
the
sum
of
five
numbers
in
a
cross
and
subtracting
the
number
on
the
opposite
corner
on
the
same
face
is
exactly
two
thousand
and
eight
so
mr
zhongxiang
bao
spent
three
entire
years
designing
this
perfect
magic
square
to
honour
the
olympics
the
development
of
magic
squares
allow
you
to
let
loose
your
imagination
the
study
of
magic
squares
is
both
rich
and
profound
in
combinatorics
there
are
many
similar
sophisticated
structures
just
now
we
covered
some
of
the
development
of
combinatorics
in
china
or
even
the
east
we
must
be
eager
to
learn
more
regarding
the
west
how
did
combinatorics
begin
and
develop
in
the
west
so
in
the
next
lesson
we
shall
begin
a
deep
discussion
about
the
development
of
combinatorics
in
the
west
