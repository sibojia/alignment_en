in
this
lesson
we
shall
learn
how
to
do
well
in
combinatorics
essentially
the
problem
of
how
to
count
well
everyone
knows
the
fundamental
concept
behind
counting
we
simply
count
one
by
one
in
computing
there
is
a
rather
more
elegant
term
for
this
enumeration
to
highlight
its
enumerative
nature
we
in
fact
call
it
brute
force
enumeration
by
its
name
we
can
tell
that
it's
not
an
overly
efficient
method
the
thinking
behind
brute
force
enumeration
is
to
count
every
single
one
of
the
possible
solutions
in
turn
in
theory
it
can
solve
all
counting
problems
of
course
saying
it
works
in
theory
implies
that
it
often
fails
in
practice
let's
see
a
simple
example
there's
a
football
world
cup
this
year(2014
many
students
may
encounter
an
awkward
problem
so
many
matches
right
in
the
middle
of
exam
season
what
should
i
do
even
if
we
refrain
from
watching
the
group
stage
matches
we
can't
bear
to
miss
the
elimination
rounds
but
how
many
of
those
are
there
we
should
plan
out
our
time
in
advance
so
let's
see
in
fact
we
have
to
count
how
many
elimination
matches
there
are
altogether
only
sixteen
teams
attending
the
world
cup
will
advance
to
the
knockout
rounds
the
tournament
system
becomes
very
harsh
single
elimination
pitting
two
teams
head
to
head
with
only
the
winner
proceeding
to
the
next
round
until
the
champion
is
decided
how
many
matches
have
to
be
played
in
this
process
let's
think
about
it
carefully
first
and
then
have
a
little
quiz
as
following
