i
think
we've
all
thought
about
it
long
and
hard
how
did
you
arrive
at
your
answer
suppose
we
want
to
have
all
the
nations
of
the
world
participating
in
the
world
cup
elimination
stage
so
if
there
are
two
hundred
and
twenty
four
teams
proceeding
to
the
elimination
stage
how
many
matches
will
be
played
so
how
did
everyone
solve
the
quiz
problem
perhaps
you
drew
a
very
complicated
decision
tree
and
counted
up
all
the
nodes
to
find
out
the
solution
if
there
are
now
two
hundred
and
twenty
four
nations
in
the
knockout
matches
will
you
still
count
like
this
how
large
must
your
decision
tree
be
is
there
a
better
way
let's
try
to
get
to
the
solution
quickly
if
we
reconsider
the
problem
it's
actually
saying
that
in
every
match
there
has
to
be
a
winner
and
a
loser
with
the
loser
being
eliminated
how
many
ultimately
remain
only
the
champion
is
left
standing
every
match
corresponds
to
an
eliminated
team
so
the
number
of
teams
eliminated
is
equal
to
the
number
of
matches
if
out
of
sixteen
teams
we
have
to
eliminate
fifteen
then
there
has
to
be
fifteen
matches
now
with
two
hundred
and
twenty
four
nations
participating
we
need
to
eliminate
two
hundred
and
twenty
three
teams
in
total
then
naturally
two
hundred
and
twenty
three
matches
have
to
be
played
this
problem
no
longer
requires
us
to
draw
up
such
a
complicated
decision
tree
we
use
a
one
to
one
correspondence
to
show
that
if
there
are
n
teams
participating
then
we
need
exactly
n
one
elimination
matches
this
one
to
one
correspondence
injectivity
demonstrates
that
brute
force
enumeration
is
not
always
necessary
we
can
use
a
degree
of
abstraction
to
generate
an
ingenious
idea
which
might
make
the
problem
wonderfully
simple
